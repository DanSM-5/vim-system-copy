INTRODUCTION                                                    *system-copy*

System copy provides vim mappings for copying / pasting text to the os
specific clipboard. Most people will be happy just setting their Vim 
clipboard to the system clipboard, but I find that doing so pollutes
my clipboard history. Instead, this plugin creates a unique mapping 
that explicitly pulls content from Vim into the system clipboard.

USAGE                                                     *system-copy-usage*

System copy provides a mapping to copy to the system clipboard using a motion
or visual selection. It also provides a mapping for pasting from the system
clipboard.

The default mapping is `cp`, and can be followed by any motion or text object.
For instance:

	`cpiw` => copy word into system clipboard
	`cpi`' => copy inside single quotes to system clipboard
	In addition, `cP` is mapped to copy the current line directly.

	The sequence `cv` is mapped to paste the content of system clipboard to
	the next line.

CLIPBOARD UTILITIES                         *system-copy-clipboard-utilities*

OSX - `pbcopy` and `pbpaste`
Windows -
  `pbcopy.exe` and `pbpaste.exe` from pasteboard if available
  `win32yank` if available or
  `clip` and `Get-Clipboard` from pwsh or powershell
Linux - `xsel` or `xclip` for x11 and `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` for wayland

Note: `xsel` or `xclip` can be installed with apt-get install `program` if your
system doesn't have any of them installed.

OPTIONS                                                 *system-copy-options*

system-copy uses default copy and paste command based on your OS, but you can
override either of these commands if you have more specific needs.

To declare custom copy command use following example:

	`let g:system_copy#copy_command='xclip -sel clipboard'`

And to declare custom paste command use:

	`let g:system_copy#paste_command='xclip -sel clipboard -o'`

If you want to silence logs when copying or pasting set:

  `let g:system_copy_silent=1`

If you are using wsl but you would like to use the windows specific commands
(specially useful in wsl1), you can set the following:

  `let g:system_copy_use_windows_clipboard=1`
